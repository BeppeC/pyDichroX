pyDichroX
---------

pyDichroX is a program written in Pyhton to analyse XAS data.

Starting from XAS scans and related logfiles, pyDichroX computes:
- from energy scans: XMCD, XNXD, XNCD, XNLD spectra;
- from magnetic field scans taken on the fly: XMCD hysteresis;
- from time scan acquisitions taken at different magnetic fields: XMCD hysteresis time-averaging the data for each field or reporting XMCD values for each time and field.

N.B. analysis routines of hysteresis data acquired with point by point methods does not discern different scan field branches. To avoid data from different branches to be averaged all together, analysis of different branches must be accomplished separately.

Results of the data analysis are saved to a csv file togheter with the final graphs.
Also a log file with information concerning experimental conditions (collected from scans' logfiles) and parameter choices durnig analysis is produced.

Making use of configuration files wich take care of specific file formats and layouts, pyDichroX can analyse data collected in different beamlines.

Currently pyDichroX analyses data from:
- DEIMOS Beamline @ Soleil Synchrotron, Paris (France) - XMCD, XNXD, XNCD, XNLD, Hystersis on the fly, Hysteresis point by point
- BOREAS Beamline @ Alba Synchrotron, Barcelona (Spain) - XMCD, XNXD, XNCD, XNLD
- APE Beamline @ Elettra Synchrotron, Trieste (Italy) - XNCD, XNLD


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python 3
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- easygui


USAGE
-----
Just run pyDichroX.py.

Dialogues and interactions through the data analysis are provided by a sequence of pup-up windows, here listed: 

- Chose the analysis type:
A dialogue asks to choose which type of analysis perform between XMCD, XNXD, XNCD, XNLD, Hysteresis on the fly and the two Hysteresis point by point analysis.

N.B. analysis routines of hysteresis data acquired with point by point methods does not discern different scan field branches. To avoid data from different branches to be averaged all together, analysis of different branches must be accomplished separately.

- Edge file selection:
Select the edge-file where edge, preedge and postedge energies of the element of interests are listed. By default edge-files are located in 'edge files' folder.
If there's no edge-file present a wizard allows to create one.
Preedge and postedge energy are used during energy scans analisi to obtain edge jump. 

- Edge chose:
Select one of the edge present in the edge-file at which work. If the edge is not present in the list, the GUI allows to add new edges.

- Insert sample angle
Insert the angle of the X-Ray beam with respect the sample.

- Select XAS data files

- Choose to add another set of data
All the further set of data will be averaged together.

- Set interpolation points numbers
During analysis, XAS spectra will be interpolated using the number of points inserted. By default the number of points in the scans is setted.

- Chose XAS spectra to average
The graphs of the scans are shown and then a dialogue ask which scans select
to be averaged and used for the analysis. Currently only for energy scan analysis.

- If configuration file is setted in order to accept scans from a reference sample, repeat the same passages before for reference scans. Currently only for energy scan analysis.

- Energies - Only for energy scans (XMCD, XNXD, XNCD, XNLD)
A graph with analyzed data is shown togheter with the position of edge energy present in the edge-file and the edge energy found from experimental data.
The average of the XAS spectra is also shown with a linear baseline based on pre and post-edge energies. Final data will be normalized based edge jump computed using both the pre-edge energy setted and linear baseline.
Another pop-up window allows to change edge, pre-edge and post-edge energies.

- Save data
In the end the final normalized data are shown and output file name is asked.
As output, a csv file with analized data, the final plots and a log file are
saved in the chosed directory.


TO DO
-----
- Add configurations in order to analyse data coming from other beamlines.
