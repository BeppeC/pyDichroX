v 2.1.0
-------
- New interactive window for select energy scan data to be average by means of check buttons.

v 2.0.0
-------
- Added new baseline extrapolation in addtion to linear one for the computation of edge jump.
Now it is possible to choose between linear and asymmetrically reweighted penalized least squares regression (2nd derivative constrained weighted regression) following the algorithm proposed by S.-J. Baek, A Park, Y.-J. Ahna and J. Choo (Analyst, 2015, 140, 250â€“257 DOI: 10.1039/c4an01061b).
- Graph window for the input of edge, pre-edge, post-edge energies and other parameters for baseline treatment is now interactive.

v 1.0.0
-------
- Added analysis for hysteresis point by point for Soleil.

v 0.4.1
-------
- Fixed some bugs on hysteresis analysis.

v 0.4.0
-------
- Added analysis for hystereis on the fly for Soleil.

v 0.3.1
-------
- Fixed a bug in dialogue for setting the edges energies.

v 0.3.0
-------
- Added configuration file for APE beamline at Elettra Synchrotron
  (Trieste, Italy).
- Now is possible to import scan data from a reference sample in order
  to normalize experimental data by reference. To activate this option
  just set True  the ref_norm attribute in configuration file.
- Fixed a bug in analysis selection.
- Fixed a bug which made crash the program if energy scan were provided
  with energy descending order.
- Fixed a bug which made crash the program if data scans have different
  lenght.

v 0.2.1
-------
- Fixed a bug in Boreas configuration files related to importing log
  information.

v 0.2.0
-------
- Added configuration for Boreas beamline at Alba Synchrotron 
  (Barcellona, Spain) to compute XMCD, XNCD, XNXD and XNLD.
- In order to correctly manage data coming from different facilities
  data log files are now mandatory for the functioning of the program.
- Data logs are now entirely managed by configuration files.
- Bug concerning overwriting of different datafile with the same name
  fixed.
